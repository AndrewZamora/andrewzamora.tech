title: Dealing with HH:MM:SS.fff in JavaScript

description: Handle time in JS when the day and year are not important.

The other day I was working with a JavaScript library that required timestamps but the data I was supplied with only contained durations of seconds (for example `2225`). The year, month and day weren't important for my use case but I can't remove them from timestamp generated by a Javascript Date object. Instead, I can set them to an arbitrary year, month and day. Then use the Javascript Date object and whatever library's functionally to manipulate `HH:MM:SS.fff` while ignoring the year, month and day. Here are a few ways to accomplish this.

My first option could have been to use the `new Date()` object to get the current date and resetting `HH:MM:SS.fff` to zero and then to my desired time.

```
const durationInSeconds = 2225;
// Sun Apr 18 2021 21:43:56 GMT+0900 (Japan Standard Time)
const exampleDate = new Date(); 

// Sun Apr 18 2021 00:43:56 GMT+0900 (Japan Standard Time)
exampleDate.setHours(0);
// Sun Apr 18 2021 00:00:56 GMT+0900 (Japan Standard Time)
exampleDate.setMinutes(0);
// Sun Apr 18 2021 00:00:00 GMT+0900 (Japan Standard Time)
exampleDate.setSeconds(0);
// Sun Apr 18 2021 00:00:00 GMT+0900 (Japan Standard Time)
exampleDate.setMilliseconds(0);
// Sun Apr 18 2021 00:37:05 GMT+0900 (Japan Standard Time)
exampleDate.setSeconds(durationInSeconds);

// Or reset the Date object in one line (and is also nice if you instead want the year/month/day and to set the HH:MM:SS.fff to zero);

// Sun Apr 18 2021 00:00:00 GMT+0900 (Japan Standard Time)
const anotherExampleDate = new Date(new Date().getFullYear(), new Date().getMonth(), new Date().getDate());
// Sun Apr 18 2021 00:37:05 GMT+0900 (Japan Standard Time)
anotherExampleDate.setSeconds(durationInSeconds);

```

The options above are fine but there is a simpler way.
